I'm a consultant at [RSG, Inc](https://rsginc.com/) where I build transportation modeling solutions. I'm also a member of the Transportation Research Board Standing Committees on [Travel Survey Methods](https://www.travelsurveymethods.org/) and Planning Analysis and Application (formerly [Transportation Planning Applications](https://trbappcon.org/), whose websites I build and maintain along with the [Ohio Travel Demand Model User Group](https://www.otdmug.org/) website.
