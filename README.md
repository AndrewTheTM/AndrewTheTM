I'm a senior consultant at [RSG, Inc](https://rsginc.com/) where I build transportation model solutions. I'm also a member and the webmaster of the Transportation Research Board Standing Committees on [Travel Survey Methods](https://www.travelsurveymethods.org/), and the webmaster for the [Ohio Travel Demand Model User Group](https://www.otdmug.org/) website.

The work I do includes:

Simulation of transportation decisions made by the inhabitants of various regions using [ActivitySim](https://github.com/ActivitySim/activitysim). I have implemented ActivitySim for multiple very large regions and worked with other systems (CT-RAMP2, CT-RAMP, TourCast) in a smaller capacity.

Data analysis and imputation for use in regional transporation simulation models, such as [imputing trucks and light commercial vehicles from location-based data](https://trid.trb.org/view/2117784), imputing and/or modeling commercial vehicle movements for multiple locations. I've also analysed data from the 2017 Great American Eclipse to prepare data that was ultimately used to plan a state's repsonse to the 2024 eclipse to ensure reasonable traffic flow.

I have worked on many transporation model application projects in varying scales (from metropolitan areas to individual intersections) in multiple parts of the country (Virginia, Ohio, and Florida). 

Aside from work, I occasionally write stuff that I think might be helpful to others at [my blog](https://www.siliconcreek.net), I run (a lot), homebrew beer, play bass, and am a licensed amateur radio operator (KE8P).
